  "readme": "## sass-brunch\nAdds Sass support to\n[brunch](http://brunch.io).\n\n## Usage\nInstall the plugin via npm with `npm install --save sass-brunch`.\n\nOr, do manual install:\n\n* Add `\"sass-brunch\": \"x.y.z\"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.\n  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.\n* If you want to use git version of plugin, add\n`\"sass-brunch\": \"git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/sass-brunch.git\"`.\n\n### Options\nForce the plugin to always use Ruby sass instead of C's libsass:\n\n```coffeescript\nconfig =\n  plugins:\n    sass:\n      mode: 'ruby'\n```\n\nSet additional include paths for libsass:\n```coffeescript\nconfig =\n  plugins:\n    sass:\n      options:\n        includePaths: ['bower_components/foundation/scss']\n```\n\nPrint line number references as comments or sass's FireSass fake media query:\n\n```coffeescript\nconfig =\n  plugins:\n    sass:\n      debug: 'comments' # or set to 'debug' for the FireSass-style output\n```\n\nTo include the source files' name/path in either debug mode, create a parent file that `@include` your actual sass/scss source. Make sure the source files are renamed to start with an underscore (`_file.scss`), or otherwise exclude them from the build so they don't get double-included.\n\nTo pass any other options to sass:\n\n```coffeescript\nconfig =\n  plugins:\n    sass:\n      options: ['--quiet']\n```\n\nUse sass/compass installed in custom location:\n```coffeescript\nconfig =\n  plugins:\n    sass:\n      gem_home: './gems'\n```\nThis could be useful for the environment which doesn't allow to install gems globally, such as CI server.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
